VP8 encoder
-----------

The gen-videos-vp8 script can be used to encode AVCHD files to
the free VP8 codec. It also adds an introductory sequence showing
the video title and other useful information.

It is not meant to be very generic. Instead, it can be used as
a starting base (that works!) which you would customize according to
your exact needs.

How to use:

- Take all your video files (should be named *.mts), and rename them
  so all the parts of the same video are named in a consistent way:
  firstvideo1.mts, firstvideo2.mts, firstvideo3.mts...
  secondvideo1.mts, secondvideo2.mts, secondvideo3.mts...

- Create a conf-list.txt file describing the various talks to process
  (see the conf-list.txt example file)
  Make sure that the 'Filename' field matches the filenames given above. 

- Customize the .svg template for the video cover. See the example
  given in this directory. Make sure that you keep the fields that 
  the gen-videos-vp8 script subsitutes with values from the conf-list.txt
  file

- Run the gen-videos-vp8 script

- Run the gen-html script to generate a web page with links to the
  videos. 

Older stuff
-----------

- gen-videos-theora:
  Our old script that encoded AVCHD videos into Ogg/Theora
  Ogg/Theora is also a free codec, but VP8 now gives better results.

- theora-intro:
  Adds an introduction video (title) to an Ogg/Theora video.
